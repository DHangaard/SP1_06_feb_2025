class Group{
 /*
 This will function as the main object being called in main file
 This class will include other classes such as 'CountryTag' 
 'CountryTag' will draw upon arrays with strings and .img flags
 Figure out a way to scale group to 1/4 of the screen
  - Maybe see group as rect with rectMode(CORNER) x placed in upper left corner
